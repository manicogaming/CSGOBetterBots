**CS2 version of these plugins is currently on hold waiting to see if Source2Mod releases**


# Edited Plugins

In here there are some plugins that I personally edited to add the features of those plugins to the BOTs. I'm using these edited plugins on a Local Server because on a public server I'll get a Token ban.

I edited the following plugins.
